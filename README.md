# MagicianAgency
A past project written for an owner of a magician agency. At the time (February 2016), this was the largest project I had ever completed. This program was written a couple months after I had first begun learning programming and it's the least sophisticated of all my projects on github. I also first learned about the STL while writing this program and tried to incorperate useful templates into it.

##Features
###Save, Load, or Create a New Project
Not only does MagicianAgency output results to a file, it also enables the ability to load existing projects. The best feature of MagicianAgency is the ability to load an existing project and create project templates. Users can close the program, re-run it and open up their project where they left off. This feature also enhanced unit testing. Instead of spending minutes and minutes typing in information, existing information could be loaded into the active program and tested. 

###Filter Results
Users have the abillity to view reversations by customer name, date, or magician name. The aspect of filtering gives the program a much more realistic feel.
